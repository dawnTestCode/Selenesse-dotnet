Deploy Fitnesse version <version>
Put the file selenesse.jar in the fitnesse/lib folder

Copy all of the pages from the SuiteSelenesseExample wiki into fitnesse/FitnesseRoot

in fitnesse, do './startFitnesse' or 'run runFitnesse.bat' to start a Fitnesse wiki 
available in a browser at http://localhost:8080

Start Selenium on the default port 4444.  (Note: we like the Sauce Labs version of 
Selenium known as Sauce RC: http://saucelabs.com/products/downloads. Not only is it 
easy to control in both Windows and *nix systems, it also fixes a bug that, as of this 
writing, makes the regular Selenium unusable on Mac OSX version 10.6.)

Click any "Suite" or "Test" buttons to run the test.  You should see an instance of 
Firefox come up and execute the search on Google for 'Selenesse', and the bars of the 
test should turn green.
